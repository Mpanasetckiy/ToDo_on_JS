<h2>Create an application that should support the following functionality:</h2>

- Creating new todos (by enter and by button)
- Changing the state of each todo (completed/not completed) and all together
- Deleting each todo and all completed
- todo text editing by double click
- Counters for the number of completed and unfulfilled todos
- Displaying the entire list, either only completed or only unfulfilled (All Active Completed)
- Own pagination (without plugins)
- To visually design a website using Bootstrap (styles, buttons, elements)
- Add validation: Set a ban on adding empty todos, todos from spaces. Multiple spaces in a row (i.e. more than one) should be reduced to one.
- Organize the escaping of scripts and symbols "#;%:?*. Protect your application from malicious attempts to interact with data.
- The site should be opened by ip address inside the network, run using nginx
